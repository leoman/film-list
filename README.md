## Movie Listings Challenge

Please make sure all dependencies are installed before running the app.

## Notes

- I choose not to use a component library like material UI etc as I wasnt sure if this would be deemed cheating. If I was to do this for real I would have been more inclined to use a open source design library if it fitted the design better for prototyping speed.
- I added a sample of tests to the application, I didnt end up testing every component, but tested the more interesting business logic. With more time I could have added tests for everything, but I didnt want to go overboard here.
- If I was to extend this, I would have joined the rating filter up with the genre filter, so only genre's would be shown when films existed at that rating. As of now they are independent filters, but that would require much more thought out selector work.

- NPM install dependencies `npm install`
- Run the application `npm start`
